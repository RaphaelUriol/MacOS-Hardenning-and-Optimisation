# MacOS-Hardenning-and-Optimisation

> __Note__

This is a All in One script made for MacOs Ventura 13.2.1, that offers a selection of configurations for Hardening your Mac, and optimizing it by disabling and configuring diferent features. The configurations are all base on CIS [Apple_macOS_13.0_Ventura_Benchmark_v1.0.0](https://downloads.cisecurity.org/#/) Feel free to comment on the parts you are not interested in. 

Many configurations and settings need to be running in sudo.

#### Legend :
Manually done : You need to do it manually following the CIS benchmark  
Included      : the script contain the code to do it automatically but it was not relevant for my use so it is commented  
Not included  : It can be done automatically but I couldn't do it, or you need to do it for each user
